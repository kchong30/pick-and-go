products[0, 0] = ["large", {"Ciabatta bun", 1, 0.50}]
products[0, 1] = ["large", {"Beef", 1, 0.75}]
products[0, 2] = ["large", {"Tomato", 2, 0.60}]
products[0, 3] = ["large", {"BBQ sauce", 1, 0.50}]

products[1, 0] = ["small", {"Rye bread", 1, 0.50}]
products[1, 1] = ["small", {"Chicken", 1, 1.00}]
products[1, 2] = ["small", {"Lettuce", 1, 0.20}]
products[1, 3] = ["small", {"Ranch dressing", 1, 0.25}]
